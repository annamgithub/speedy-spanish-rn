## Overview
SpeedySpanish is a React Native-built mobile app featuring two types of drills I deemed, from personal experience, to be important for beginner learners of Spanish.

The first type is the flashcard-based vocabulary builder. To progress through the flashcards, the user can swipe left or right in order to get to the next card in the deck. In order to view the English translation of the Spanish word on display, the user simply has to tap the card once.

The second type of drill that is featured in the app is for practicing verb conjugations. A Spanish sentence is displayed with the unconjugated verb left blank. Users can select what they think is the correct conjugation from a set of four choices. When an answer is selected, the user is told whether the answer was right or wrong, and then can move on to the next question.

I designed and built the user interface, although the impressive flamenco dancer image on the cover was provided by AnnaliseArt, whose work can be found on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/flamenco-dancer-woman-spain-dancer-5317023/).


## Try It Out
### Getting Started
If you don’t already have Node and Watchman installed, you should get them via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following terminal commands:

`brew install node
brew install watchman`

While you probably have these as a React Native developer, it is a good idea to at least install Node 10 or later. 

Next, if you don't have Xcode, you’ll need to install it. You can just download it from the app store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). You’ll also need CocoaPods, which manages library dependencies for your projects when using Xcode. So, install using:

`sudo gem install cocoapods`

### Installing the Application
In your terminal, go to a location where you wish to clone the project, then run:

`git git@github.com:annamgithub/speedy-spanish-rn.git`  
`cd speedy-spanish-rn`  
`npm install`  

### Running the Application
In the terminal, navigate to the location you had installed the app, then run:

`npx react-native run-ios`
